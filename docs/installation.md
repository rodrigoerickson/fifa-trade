# Installation

## Introduction

This is just an unofficial guide to show you how to install the dependencies for running UI automation test with Selenium and JavaScript.

Although I use Yarn, you can use NPM if you want to.

## Start your project

```sh
yarn init
OR
npm init
```

## Install dependencies

This project will start with Chrome broswer and mocha for testing purposes.

```sh
yarn add chromedriver selenium-webdriver
```

```sh
yarn add mocha -D
```
