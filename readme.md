# Automation Testing with Selenium and JavaScript

This is an unofficial guide to UI Automation Testing by using Selenium and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

You need to install either [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine. In this project, I will use Yarn for installing packages and running scripts.

```sh
yarn install
```

## Running UI Test

```sh
yarn run test
```
